# QA Checklist for Gatekeeping Quality

Welcome to the QA Checklist repository! This comprehensive checklist is designed to help Quality Assurance (QA) professionals effectively gatekeep quality across various testing domains. It covers **functional**, **UI**, **API**, **performance**, and **security** testing, making it an invaluable resource for QAs with 1 to 5 years of experience. The goal is to ensure the delivery of robust and reliable software.

## Functional Testing

Functional testing focuses on verifying that each function of the software application operates in conformance with the requirement specification.

## UI Testing

UI testing ensures that the user interface meets the design specifications and provides a seamless user experience across different devices and browsers.

## API Testing

API testing involves testing application programming interfaces (APIs) directly to ensure they meet functionality, reliability, performance, and security expectations.

## Performance Testing

Performance testing is carried out to determine how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload.

## Security Testing

Security testing aims to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities to protect the application from potential threats and attacks.
